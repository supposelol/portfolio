                    My experience learning to code has been a unique one. Before moving to the US, I owned
                    and operated my own massage salon back in Hungary. It helped me develop
                    skills like entrepreneurship and client services, but I was always driven to follow
                    my early dream of working with computers and coding.

                    The mid-2000s were a time when I honed my creative side by designing intros and avatars
                    in browser-based games â€” a simpler era for online gaming (~_^). It was then that I came upon
                    my apprecciation for coding and design. These simple customizations sparked an obsession that never
                    went away, even as I built a career in a very different field.

                    Following my relocation to America, I expanded my knowledge of in-demand languages and frameworks.
                    What sets me apart is that my background made me love working with people and
                    customers, allowing me to collaborate with others easily.
