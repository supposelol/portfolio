                        My experience learning to code has been a unique one. Before moving to the US, I owned
                        and operated my own massage salon back in Hungary. It helped me develop
                        skills like entrepreneurship and client services, but I was always driven to follow
                        my early dream of working with computers and coding.

                        The mid-2000s were a time when I honed my creative side by designing intros and avatars
                        in browser-based games â€” a simpler era for online gaming (~_^). It was then that I came upon
                        my apprecciation for coding and design. These simple customizations hooked me,
                        even as I built a career in a very different field.

                        Following my relocation to America, I expanded my knowledge of in-demand languages and frameworks.
                        What sets me apart is that my background made me love working with people and
                        customers, allowing me to collaborate with others easily.
